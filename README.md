The game involves players moving around the board. There is always 1 bear and between 1 to 3 wolves representing the players. Sheep are randomly placed on the board, and the players' goal is to eat them when encountered on their path. The bear moves straight ahead a randomly chosen number of spaces on the dice (1-6 spaces), while the wolves move diagonally. There is also a shepherd on the board. If the bear encounters the shepherd, it eats him and can continue moving, whereas a wolf bounces off him and changes its direction of movement. Each sheep eaten scores 1 point; eating the Shepherd does not award points. At the start of the game, each player is located on the starting line (the first line of the board), and the game ends when each player reaches the finish line, with the winner being the one who has the most points (a tie is possible).

The game has some limitations:
The board must be between 7x7 and 40x40 in size.
The number of sheep must be between 20% and 50% of the total number of available spaces.
The number of wolves must be between 1 to 3.
